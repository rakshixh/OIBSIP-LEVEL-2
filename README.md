## Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to serve as a learning resource for interns participating in the Oasis Infobyte internship program for web development and designing. Through hands-on projects like the Calculator, Tribute Page, and To-Do App, interns will gain practical experience in front-end web development technologies and techniques.

We encourage interns to explore, experiment, and collaborate on these projects to enhance their skills and deepen their understanding of web development principles and best practices.
